# How it works?

- Derives an unqiue identity from mobile device which is then used to,
  - The unique identity helps to uniquely identify the device for eSIM installation and installation.
- Deploy smart wallets and allows to purchase eSIMs for connectivity and
  - Smart Wallets deployed on decentralised networks, provide true ownership of eSIM and digital assets as the credentials of access to the wallets are stored in the mobile device secure element using `passkeys` similar how eSIM credentials are stored within secure element using `euiccmanager`.
- Opens up the domain of digital assets in one platform.
