# The Problem with eSIMs

With the new specification **"eSIM"** which solves a few problems faced in **SIM Card** and gives consumers the freedom to remotely connect devices, such as wearables, to a mobile network of their choice and continues to evolve the process of connectivity.

_Independent service providers can now transmit commands to generate and store eSIM Profiles on certified data centers (Subscription Managers) and also load these profiles onto end-user devices, reducing the complexity of distribuitng telecommunication services and enabling more service providers to enter the market._

eSIMs offer numerous benefits, such as easier carrier switching and reduced physical SIM card dependency. However, they also introduce several security and privacy concerns. Here are the most prominent problems associated with eSIMs:
1. Remote SIM Provisioning Vulnerabilities
    - eSIMs rely on remote provisioning, which can be exploited by attackers to activate or switch profiles without the user's consent.
    - During the provisioning process, **Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)** attacks could intercept communication between the device and the carrier, potentially compromising the eSIM profile.
2. Device and Carrier Dependence
    - The device hosting the eSIM is a single point of failure, if it becomes compromised the eSIM Profile could be misused, manipulated or stolen before user can take action.
    - Weak security practices by mobile carriers results in exposed consumer eSIM profiles to hacking or unauthorized access.
3. Privacy Concerns
    - Since eSIMs are completely digital and the profiles are owned by Operators instead of consumers, eSIMs can make it easier for carriers or third parties to track user behavior across multiple networks, raising privacy concerns.
    - Carriers and device manufacturers may collect and share more user data through eSIMs, potentially violating user privacy.
4. Lack of Standardization
    - The absence of universal security standards for eSIM implementation across carriers and manufacturers can lead to vulnerabilities. The security specifications published by governing bodies like GSMA are outdated and insufficient against state-of-art attacks.
    -  Poorly implemented eSIM solutions may expose users to security risks when switching between carriers or devices.
5. Physical Security Risks
    - If a device with an eSIM is stolen, the thief could potentially transfer the eSIM profile to another device, bypassing traditional SIM card protections.
    - eSIMs are embedded in devices, making them harder to remove or replace, but also harder to secure against physical tampering.
6. User Awareness and Control
    - Users have less visibility and control over eSIM profiles compared to physical SIM cards, making it harder to detect unauthorized changes.
    - The technical nature of eSIMs can make it difficult for non tech-savvy users to manage their profiles securely.
7. Regulatory and Legal Challenges
    - eSIMs can complicate legal and regulatory compliance, especially when users switch carriers across different countries with varying privacy laws.
    - Determining liability in cases of eSIM-related fraud or data breaches can be challenging.
8. Potential Exploitation by Malware
    - Malicious software could target eSIMs to steal profiles, intercept communications, or disrupt services. 
    - Weak authentication mechanisms for eSIM provisioning could make it easier for malware to exploit vulnerabilities.
9. Dependence on Device Manufacturers
    - eSIMs are fully suceptible to malicious/negligent manufacturers. If device manufacturers implement backdoors or weak security measures, eSIMs could be compromised.
    - The complexity of eSIM specification makes it harder for manufacturers to make secure implementations. Devices with eSIMs may not receive timely security updates, leaving them vulnerable to exploits.  
10. Social Engineering Risks
    - Attackers could use social engineering to convince carriers to transfer eSIM profiles to a device under their control (i.e. a SIM Swap Attack).
    - Users could be phished into revealing eSIM-related credentials or authorizing malicious profile changes.
