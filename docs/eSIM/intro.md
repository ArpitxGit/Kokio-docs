# Introduction

An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM card that's embedded directly into a device, such as a phone or smartwatch, This new specification gives consumers the freedom to remotely connect devices, such as wearables, to a mobile network of their choice and continues to evolve the process of connecting new and innovative devices.

The change from the Removable SIM to an eSIM provides benefits for many players:

- For everyone, eSIM provides an equivalent level of security as the removable SIM card. This is vital as it is the subscription credentials stored on the SIM card that enable secure and private access to mobile networks. It also supports the integrity of the billing process, especially in roaming scenarios.
- For the device end user, eSIM enables simplified management of subscriptions and connections. End users will no longer have to manage several SIM cards.
- For distributors, simplified logistics are possible, customisation for specific operators or regions may be reduced.
- Operators will have simpler means to expand their businesses into emerging markets, for example, automotive, wearables and consumer electronics. SIM card distribution costs will be eliminated, and eSIMs will enable new distribution models for devices and for marketing of subscriptions.
- Device Manufacturers, can exploit the reduced space within their products to make smaller devices. Their products could also be made more tolerant to environmental factors such as dampness, temperature and vibration as they can be hermetically (completely airtight) sealed. Manufacturers can also leverage eSIMs to optimise supply chain processes.
