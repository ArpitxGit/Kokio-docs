# Smart Contract Wallets

Smart contract wallets for eSIMs provide a secure, decentralized solution for managing eSIM-related activities such as activation, profile switching, and payments.  
With a smart contract wallet, users can store their eSIM profiles in a tamper-proof and transparent environment, where automated rules govern actions like transferring ownership, changing network plans, or updating profiles without needing intermediaries.
