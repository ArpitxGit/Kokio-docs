# Registry Contract

This contract deploys both the Device Wallet Factory and the eSIM Wallet Factory. It serves as a central registry, tracking all Device and eSIM Wallets, ensuring their validity. Any wallets deployed outside this suite are considered invalid. Users can interact with the Registry Contract to deploy their first Device and eSIM Wallets. Additionally, it coordinates with the Lazy Wallet Registry to allow deferred smart wallet deployment.
