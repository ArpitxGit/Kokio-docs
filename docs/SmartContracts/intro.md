# Smart Contract

Smart contracts improves the management of profile arrays stored in independent certified data centers by automating and securing the process of transmitting and loading SIM profiles.  
Through a decentralized and transparent mechanism, smart contracts ensure that only authorized entities can access or modify profiles, reducing the risk of unauthorized tampering or data breaches.

## Smart Contract Wallets

Smart contract wallets for eSIMs provide a secure, decentralized solution for managing eSIM-related activities such as activation, profile switching, and payments.  
With a smart contract wallet, users can store their eSIM profiles in a tamper-proof and transparent environment, where automated rules govern actions like transferring ownership, changing network plans, or updating profiles without needing intermediaries.

## Self Custodial

A self-custodial smart contract wallet on a mobile device gives users full control over their assets, including eSIM profiles, without relying on a third party for security or management.  
_**The user holds the private keys directly on their device, enabling them to execute actions like profile switching, payments, and authentication autonomously.**_
With a mobile-first approach, the wallet is designed for everyday users, offering a user-friendly interface that simplifies managing eSIM profiles, performing transactions and manage digital assets.
