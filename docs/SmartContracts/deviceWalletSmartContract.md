# Device Wallet Smart Contract

Each mobile device is assigned a unique Device Wallet. The app generates P256 keys using passkeys to verify ownership. These wallets allow users to store ETH and ERC-20 tokens, offering full control over their assets and enabling data bundle purchases for their associated eSIMs.
