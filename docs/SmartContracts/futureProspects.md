# Future Prospects

- **Asset Recovery**:  
   Currently, users own their Device and eSIM Wallets and can transfer ownership to another Ethereum address. In the future, recovery rights may be assigned to a secondary keystore, allowing users to recover wallets in case of device loss.

- **Unique Device bound identity**:  
   Currently, the device unique identifier is generated using some device parameters, but it would be great if we could bound an identifier with the secure enclave (TEE) of the mobile devie and associate it with the smart wallet, thus making it a device bound smart wallet.
