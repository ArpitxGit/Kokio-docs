# Self Custodial

A self-custodial smart contract wallet on a mobile device gives users full control over their assets, including eSIM profiles, without relying on a third party for security or management.  
_**The user holds the private keys directly on their device, enabling them to execute actions like profile switching, payments, and authentication autonomously.**_
With a mobile-first approach, the wallet is designed for everyday users, offering a user-friendly interface that simplifies managing eSIM profiles, performing transactions and manage digital assets.
