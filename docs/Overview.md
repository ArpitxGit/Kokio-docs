  # 5. [**3 ways not to screw up an eSIM design**](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/industries/industrial/3-ways-not-to-screw-up-an-esim-design)

  **After remaining essentially unchanged for more than 25 years, the Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) used to authenticate devices onto cellular networks are undergoing a dramatic transformation, moving from physical hardware to downloadable software – embodied by the concept of eSIMs. Cyril Caillaud, NXP Semiconductors, explains.**


  ### 1. Start with standards

  Standardisation is crucial in cellular technology as it helps establish a baseline for interoperability and security.

  Multiple standards bodies, including 3GPP, ETSI, GlobalPlatform, GSMA, ENISA, EuroSmart, and the Trusted Connectivity Alliance (TCA), work to develop standards for cellular technology.

  Testing is necessary to achieve true interoperability and ensure that devices work together seamlessly. This requires testing beyond the scope of standards, including corner cases, new and uncommon use cases, and systems external to the eSIM.

  - Standardisation establishes a baseline for interoperability and security in cellular technology.
  - Multiple standards bodies work to develop standards for cellular technology, including 3GPP, ETSI, GlobalPlatform, GSMA, ENISA, EuroSmart, and the Trusted Connectivity Alliance (TCA).
  - Testing is necessary to achieve true interoperability and ensure that devices work together seamlessly.
  - Testing should go beyond the scope of standards to include legacy profile structures, specific test suites from Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), proprietary back-end platforms behaviours for Over-The-Air (OTA) eSIM profile life cycle management, and other areas that fall outside standardisation.
  - Corner cases, including backward compatibility, should be tested comprehensively to include all technologies, including past, present, and future.
  - New and uncommon use cases should be considered, and test cases should be developed to prepare for the unexpected.
  - Systems external to the eSIM, such as the device's host processor, modem, and Local Profile Assistant (LPA) used to manage profiles, should be deeply examined, and tests for interoperability should be developed.
  - Supporting technologies, such as the secure element, NFC, and UWB, should be considered when testing eSIM designs.


  ### 2. **Begin testing early**

  The challenges that arise while developing and deploying eSIMs. The OEMs finish the eUICC tests and design before MNO testing even starts, leading to misalignment in features and service roadmap, causing unexpected costs, lack of resources and delay in the device and eSIM service launch. Therefore, it is essential to follow the communication chain to ensure technical compliance and anticipate testing to ensure mass adoption.

  **Questions & Feedback:**

  received this tweet from [FrancescoRenziA](https://twitter.com/FrancescoRenziA)

  - Definitely interesting to couple an eSim with a crypto wallet. But was surprised to see you weren't actually generating the wallet using the eSim's software. If that were possible it could be pretty interesting

  Solution:

  - Coupling an eSIM with a crypto wallet can provide a convenient and secure way to manage cryptocurrency holdings.
  - An eSIM is a digital SIM card built into a device that can be programmed with multiple profiles from different mobile network operators.
  - An eSIM can enable seamless and secure access to your cryptocurrency holdings, no matter where you are in the world.
  - The combination of an eSIM and a crypto wallet can provide a convenient and secure way to manage your cryptocurrency holdings, especially for those who travel frequently or need to access their funds from different locations.
  - It's technically possible to generate a cryptocurrency wallet using the software on an eSIM, but it's not a common practice at the moment.
  - Cryptocurrency wallets are typically generated using dedicated software applications or web-based services and are stored on a device's internal storage or an external hardware device.
  - Some companies are exploring the use of eSIMs for secure storage and management of private keys, which are a critical component of cryptocurrency wallets, but this is still an emerging technology.

  **Questions & Feedback:**

  By [Nabeel](https://twitter.com/NabeelK4122),

  _**That's a great idea, just had a few things, I was trying to prove uniqueness of a device, to avoid malicious attacks, but got stuck with the reading of the hardware data, could you let me know how would the software wallets be able to read the hardware, eSIM ID,**_

  Reply: _**So in the design of eSIM, i'm ensuring the uniqueness of a device by uploading the encrypted eSIM ID alongside with the primary wallet address(and a few other values) on the blockchain network while activation.**_ Storing the eSIM ID alongside the wallet addresses on the blockchain network during the activation of the eSIM could be a valid way to prove the uniqueness of a device. By linking the eSIM ID to the specific wallet addresses of the user, you can ensure that only the owner of the corresponding wallet can use the eSIM.

  **Progress Report:**

  Week3 went great and cleared lots of concepts(including small details about the structure of traditional eSIM).

  - Content of eSIM whitepaper has been updated in the doc as a toggle.

  **Next Steps:**

  - Simplifying the existing structure to make it understandable to everyone.
  - Proceed to ZKP.

  **Questions & Feedback:**

  From sir [Jaf](https://twitter.com/jafetsc):

  - Plug-in your solution at the "Retrieve SIM from inventory" step.

    - so you can serve as a "provider" for for any Telecom company to offer **Blockchain Powered eSIM** ?
    - And of course the web3 portion will have everything else we discussed regarding delegation of wallets.

  ![image.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/08017db5-5e5e-46ea-ab31-14bffcae0632/image.png)

  - why an eSIM design or architecture paper? SIMs hold different types of data not only the IMEI.
  - Are you eventually going for a modification to the eSIM - meaning adding 1 more field called wallet address (or similar)
    - I eventually want to do a modification to the traditional eSIM. And build a firmware of this design to run it on a software(have to ask GSMA for this). The reason for creating an eSIM design or architecture paper is to provide a detailed overview of how the eSIM solution will work and how it will integrate with the user's crypto wallets. Outlining the technical specifications and design considerations for building the eSIM solution, including the use of blockchain and cryptographic identity services. And regarding the SIMs holding different types of data, that is correct. And here we are specifically focused on the eSIM's unique ID, mapped/coupled to the user's crypto wallets, enabling them to access applications and services using their fingerprints. This unique ID will be used as a means of authentication, providing a secure and decentralized solution that is resistant to data breaches and other security threats.

# eSIM

An **eSIM**(**embedded-SIM**) is a form of programmable [SIM card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card) that is embedded directly into a device.

Instead of an [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) located on a removable [universal integrated circuit card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_integrated_circuit_card) (UICC), typically made of [PVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PVC), an eSIM consists of software installed onto an [eUICC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUICC) chip permanently attached to a device.

Once an eSIM carrier profile has been installed on an eUICC, it operates the same as a physical SIM, complete with a unique [ICCID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICCID) and [network authentication key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card#Authentication_key_\(Ki\)) generated by the carrier.

The eSIM standard was first released in 2016; since that point, eSIM has begun to replace physical SIM in domains including cellular telephony.

Since 2010, the GSMA had been discussing the possibility of a software-based SIM.

To avoid any confusion, suggesting the following way of looking at the definition:

> **"eSIM is the whole service - SIM + eUICC + platform eUICC is the software that allows provisioning."**

And also the difference

![Screenshot 2023-03-10 at 6.46.36 AM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a4fa2f01-307b-4780-8029-b005f7d754ea/Screenshot_2023-03-10_at_6.46.36_AM.png)

- An eSIM, or embedded SIM, is a programmable SIM card that is built into a device and can be remotely activated and provisioned.
- It's not a software in the traditional sense, but it can be thought of as an integrated circuit that contains firmware and data storage.
- The structure of an eSIM is similar to a traditional SIM card, but it's an electronic chip embedded in the device's hardware.
- eSIMs have a unique identifier, which is similar to a traditional SIM card's ICCID, and can store multiple network profiles that can be activated based on the user's preference.
- eSIMs work by using remote provisioning to download and install network profiles over the air (OTA).
- The remote provisioning process involves several steps, including registration, download, activation, and management.
- eSIMs provide enhanced security features, such as encryption and authentication, to protect user credentials and prevent fraud.
- eSIM technology provides a flexible and secure way to activate and manage network services on a device without the need for physical SIM cards.
- eSIMs are an important technology for enabling cellular connectivity on a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, wearables, and IoT devices.

**NOTICE: Look into nuSIM in the near future.**

In 2021, [Deutsche Telekom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Telekom) introduced an alternative to eSIMs for smaller devices and the Internet of Things in form of integrated SIMs (iSIMs) fully integrated into a security enclave of the modem SoC (System on Chip). Called nuSIM they are smaller, cheaper and more eco-friendly since no extra hardware and plastic is required. In addition they can meet the same security requirements than a classical or eSIMs; they ease the logistics and production of small devices. It can be expected that because of these advantages iSIMs will also replace the (e)SIMs in mobile phones and other connected consumer devices in future.

## Security Concern in the Telecom Industry

Security concerns in the telecom industry are multifaceted, and as the industry evolves with new technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing, the security challenges are expected to grow in both number and complexity.

Here are some of the main security concerns:

1. **Data Privacy and Protection**: Telecom companies handle a vast amount of sensitive customer data including personal identification information, call records, and billing information. Unauthorized access to this data can lead to identity theft and fraud.
2. **Network Security**: Telecom networks are highly distributed and complex. Security of the network infrastructure, including the protection of communication lines and data centers, is crucial. Attacks on these networks can result in service outages, financial losses, and damage to reputation.
3. **Fraud**: Telecom fraud is a major concern, including subscription fraud, SIM card swapping, and IRSF (International Revenue Share Fraud). Fraud can result in significant financial losses for both the telecom provider and the consumer.
4. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**: These attacks are aimed at making telecom services unavailable by overwhelming them with traffic. This not only affects the availability but can also be used as a smokescreen for other types of attacks.
5. **Supply Chain Security**: Telecom infrastructure often relies on hardware and software sourced from multiple suppliers. Risks include counterfeit components, or components with built-in vulnerabilities.
6. **5G Security**: The deployment of 5G networks brings new security concerns. 5G networks rely on software-defined networking which, although flexible, brings additional risks. Also, the increased number of connected devices (IoT) through 5G networks expands the attack surface.
7. **Insider Threats**: Employees or other insiders with access to sensitive information or critical systems pose a security risk. They might inadvertently or intentionally misuse their access to compromise security.
8. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: The telecom industry is subject to various national and international regulations regarding data protection and security. Non-compliance can result in hefty fines and legal actions.
9. **Third-party Risks**: Telecom companies frequently collaborate with third parties such as vendors and contractors. These third parties might not have robust security practices, posing a risk to the telecom companies’ data and systems.
10. **Interception and Eavesdropping**: Telecom networks are susceptible to interception and eavesdropping. This includes unauthorized interception of phone calls, text messages, and internet traffic.
11. **Physical Security**: The physical security of facilities, such as data centers and network hubs, is vital. Unauthorized access to these facilities can lead to theft or sabotage.
12. **Security Patch Management**: Telecom infrastructure often comprises a vast range of technologies, each requiring regular updates and patches. Managing these patches is complex but crucial to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

Addressing these security concerns requires a multifaceted approach that includes implementing robust security policies, continuous monitoring, employee training, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations. Telecom companies need to be proactive in identifying emerging threats and adapting their security measures accordingly.


## **ECASD**

The Embedded UICC Controlling Authority Security Domain (ECASD) is responsible for the secure storage of credentials needed to support the required security domains on the eUICC.

There SHALL only be one ECASD on an eUICC. The ECASD SHALL be installed and personalised by the EUM during the eUICC manufacturing as described in GlobalPlatform Card Specification \[9].

The ECASD SHALL contain the following:

- eUICC private keys for creating signatures.
- Associated Certificates for eUICC Authentication.
- The Certificate Issuers’ (CI) root public keys for verifying SM-DP+ and SM-DS Certificates.
- eUICC Manufacturers’ (EUMs) keyset for key/Certificate renewal.

Additionally, the ECASD SHALL provide security functions used during key establishment and eUICC Authentication.


## Private credentials stored in eSIM

An eSIM (embedded Subscriber Identity Module) is a digital SIM that allows you to activate a cellular plan from your carrier without having to use a physical SIM card. eSIMs are built into a device during its manufacturing process, making it easier to change carriers or activate a new plan.

Private credentials are stored securely within the eSIM infrastructure to ensure the security and privacy of the user. Specifically, these credentials include:

1. ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier): This is the identifier of the physical SIM or eSIM. It's stored in the eSIM and is used by the carrier to identify the eSIM on their network.
2. IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity): This is a unique identifier that defines a subscriber in the wireless world, including the country and mobile network to which the subscriber belongs. It's stored in the eSIM and is used by the carrier to provide the subscriber with the appropriate services.
3. Authentication Keys (Ki): These are secret keys used for authentication between the mobile device and the carrier's network. They are also stored in the eSIM.
4. Profiles: These are sets of information that include the operator's credentials, settings, and other data required to connect to a network. They can be downloaded, updated, or deleted on the eSIM as needed.

All these credentials are securely stored in the eSIM, and the eSIM itself is securely stored within the device. This data is encrypted and can only be accessed by the network provider for authentication purposes, ensuring the security and privacy of the user's information. The specifics of where exactly these details are stored can vary by device manufacturer and network provider, but in all cases, they are stored in such a way as to prevent unauthorized access.


### Where they are stored in android eSIM implementation?

The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) provides a high-level overview of eSIM support in Android, although it doesn't specifically detail the precise location of private credential storage. However, it does state that eSIM profiles, which include the necessary private credentials for network access and user identification, are stored securely on the device.

Android utilizes the LPA (Local Profile Assistant) for managing eSIM profiles. The LPA is part of the system that communicates with the eUICC (embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card), where the eSIM profiles are stored. The eUICC is a secure element within the device that stores and protects these profiles.

eSIM profiles, which include the private credentials, are stored within the secure eUICC environment. The security of the eUICC is crucial to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the subscriber's credentials.

As part of Android's eSIM implementation, there are APIs that handle the downloading, enabling, and disabling of profiles. However, the actual storage of profiles and sensitive data happens within the secure eUICC, and this process is designed to be transparent to applications and users.

Keep in mind that the actual implementation can vary among different Android device manufacturers, as they might choose to implement additional layers of security or use different hardware for eSIM support.


### What's the size of the storage within the secure eUICC environment where all these credentials are stored and how?

The eUICC, or embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card, has memory storage capabilities similar to a traditional physical SIM card. The actual size can vary depending on the manufacturer and model of the eUICC, but it typically ranges from 64KB to 512KB. Some newer models might offer even larger storage capacities.

This memory space is used to store multiple eSIM profiles, each of which includes:

- An ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier)
- An IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)
- Authentication Keys
- Operator-defined data, like network settings

The eUICC operates in a secure and isolated environment within the device, ensuring that the data stored on it is protected from unauthorized access. The credentials are typically encrypted and can only be accessed by the carrier network for authentication and service provision purposes.

The eUICC is designed to allow over-the-air management of the profiles stored within it, which includes functions like downloading, enabling/disabling, and deleting profiles. This is managed by the Local Profile Assistant (LPA) in the device, which communicates with the Subscription Manager (SM) in the carrier's network. The secure communication between these elements ensures the safe management of the profiles and their associated credentials.

It's worth noting that the exact implementation can vary among different device manufacturers and network carriers, and they might choose to use different methods for data storage and security within the eUICC.


## Secure storage in AOSP

In the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), secure storage is an essential aspect to protect sensitive user data and credentials. There are several components and mechanisms for secure storage in AOSP:

1. **Keystore**: Android's Keystore system is used to store cryptographic keys in a container, making it more difficult to extract them from the device. Keys stored in Keystore can be used for cryptographic operations without exposing their key material.
2. **Encrypted Filesystem**: Android supports file-based encryption (FBE) and full-disk encryption (FDE). FBE allows different files to be encrypted with different keys that can be unlocked independently. FDE encrypts the entire data partition with a single key.
3. **Credential Storage**: Android provides a secure method for storing credentials such as private keys and certificates. This is used in conjunction with VPNs and Wi-Fi for network security.
4. **Hardware-Backed Storage**: Many Android devices offer hardware-backed storage for encryption keys and other sensitive data. This means the key material is stored in a secure hardware module and never exposed to the rest of the system.
5. **SafetyNet Attestation**: SafetyNet provides APIs that help you assess the security and compatibility of the Android environments in which your apps run.
6. **Scoped Storage**: In newer versions of Android, apps have scoped access to external storage, limiting their access to certain directories. This ensures that apps cannot access sensitive data stored by other apps.
7. **Shared Preferences**: For application-specific data, developers often use Shared Preferences, which can be set to private mode, meaning the data stored is only accessible by the application itself.
8. **Android Protected Confirmation**: On supported devices, apps can use the Android Protected Confirmation API to display a UI prompt to the user, ensuring that a sensitive transaction is authorized by the user, and the response is signed by a key stored in secure hardware.
9. **eUICC Secure Storage**: As mentioned earlier, for eSIM profiles and related sensitive information, Android uses eUICC secure storage.
10. **Biometric Authentication**: Android supports biometric authentication, allowing sensitive operations or data to be secured behind biometric credentials (fingerprint, face, etc.).

These components work together to create a layered security model, protecting sensitive user data and ensuring that Android devices can be used securely.

The term "Secure Enclave" is primarily associated with Apple's iOS devices. It refers to a hardware-based secure coprocessor that is used to enhance security by isolating sensitive data and operations from the main processor.

However, a similar concept exists in the Android ecosystem, where it's often referred to as a "Hardware Security Module" (HSM) or "Trusted Execution Environment" (TEE).

In Android devices, the TEE is a secure area inside the main processor. It ensures that sensitive data is stored, processed, and protected in an isolated environment. The TEE can be used for various purposes such as:

- **Secure Key Storage**: The TEE can store cryptographic keys in a way that they are never exposed to the rest of the system.
- **Data Encryption and Decryption**: The TEE can handle encryption and decryption operations, making sure that the encryption keys and unencrypted data are not accessible by the OS or other apps.
- **Fingerprint and Facial Recognition Data**: Biometric data, which is highly sensitive, is often processed within the TEE to ensure it's not accessible to potential attackers.
- **Secure Boot**: The TEE can be used to verify the integrity of the boot process, ensuring that the device hasn't been tampered with.
- **DRM (Digital Rights Management)**: The TEE can be used for DRM protections, ensuring that high-value content is securely handled and rendered.

Manufacturers may implement the TEE in different ways, and some may use dedicated hardware separate from the main processor, similar to Apple's Secure Enclave.

The implementation of a TEE or similar secure enclave technology is essential in modern smartphones to protect sensitive user data and to secure communications and transactions.


## AOSP Platform-specific cryptography libraries

And similar component in mac and in non-mac devices

1. **Platform-Specific Cryptography Libraries in AOSP**:

   AOSP stands for Android Open Source Project. It is the open-source version of the Android operating system. When referring to platform-specific cryptography libraries, it means libraries that are tailored and optimized for Android devices.

   - **Android Keystore System**: One of the main components in Android for secure storage is the Android Keystore System. This allows applications to store cryptographic keys in a container, making it more difficult to extract the keys from the device. The keys can be used for encryption, decryption, or signing data without revealing the key material.
   - **Tink**: Another option is Google's Tink library which is a multi-language, cross-platform library that provides cryptographic APIs that are secure and easy to use. It also integrates well with the Android Keystore.
   - **Bouncy Castle**: It is a third-party library which is widely used, though Android has its own version of Bouncy Castle integrated.
   - **libsodium**: It's not Android-specific, but it's a modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing, and more.

2. **Secure Enclave Equivalent in Non-Apple Devices**:

   The term "Secure Enclave" is mainly used by Apple for a hardware-based key management system, but the concept exists in other platforms under different names.

   - **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**: It’s a secure area inside a main processor. It guarantees code and data loaded inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. In Android, Hardware-backed Keystore can leverage TEE for secure key management similar to Secure Enclave.
   - **Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions)**: This technology by Intel allows user-level as well as operating system code to define private regions of memory, called enclaves, which are designed to be protected from processes running at higher privilege levels.
   - **ARM TrustZone**: It's used in ARM processors, which are commonly used in Android devices. TrustZone is a hardware isolation built into the CPU and can be seen as a TEE. It allows a device to run trusted applications in an isolated and secure environment.

Each of these technologies provides hardware-based security features that can be used for securely managing sensitive data like cryptographic keys, much like Apple’s Secure Enclave.


## [**Which smartphones support eSIM, other than iPhone?**](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/mobile/connectivity/esim/what-is-an-esim)

The [](https://esim.holafly.com/how-to/esim-phones/)list of compatible eSIM devices (click on the links below for each segment) is getting longer as we speak.

It's only a matter of time before many devices, from phones, wearables and tablets, and portable PCs, embrace embedded SIM cards.

Why?

It's because major operating systems such as Google's Android and Wear OS, Apple's IOS, and [Windows 10 and 11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/cellular-settings-in-windows-905568ff-7f31-3013-efc7-3f396ac92cd7) support eSIM.

These ecosystems are creating a powerful momentum for eSIMs.

- [Phones](https://esim.holafly.com/how-to/esim-phones/): Currently, Apple iPhones, Google Pixel series, Samsung Galaxy series, Motorola Razr series, Huawei, Oppo, Rakuten, and Sony, to name a few, support eSIM.
- [Watches](https://esim.holafly.com/how-to/smartwatches-compatible-esim/): The Apple Watch, Huawei Watch 2, the Samsung Gear and Galaxy Watch, and OPPO Watch are eSIM-ready.
- Other [devices](https://esim.holafly.com/how-to/esim-compatible-laptops/): Apple iPads, many ACER, ASUS, DELL, HP, Lenovo, and Microsoft SURFACE models have adopted the eSIM format. Huawei also has eSIM-enabled models.


## **eSIM and 5G**

Both 5G and eSIM are being extensively adopted by industry stakeholders worldwide.

According to the GSMA [Mobile Economy 2022](https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280222-The-Mobile-Economy-2022.pdf) report:

- 5G connections will surpass 2 billion by 2025,
- 5G will account for over a fifth of total mobile connections by the end of 2025,
- More than 40% of the world's population will live within reach of a 5G network.

But there’s another reason why eSIM and 5G are taking the world by storm.

They are also great for **connected devices**.


## eSIM and the Internet of Things

The GSMA states that 5G adds momentum to the use of cellular connectivity for the Internet of Things (IoT), pushing eSIM adoption as well.

[Kaleido Intelligence](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/esim-connections-exceed-4-5-081000973.html), a leading connectivity market intelligence and consulting firm, expects eSIM connections to exceed **4.5 billion in 2027**, driven by a booming consumer market.

> _**5G and eSIM are thus being rolled-out globally, and -when combined- lead to very innovative services that were not possible until now.**_

5G and eSIM (aka [IoT eSIM](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/iot-connectivity/industrial-sim)) are ideally suited in applications such as smart metering for remote operated management, robotics and asset monitoring, surveillance cameras in smart cities and factories, connected ambulances, medical monitoring devices and more.

But that’s not all. They are also great for **enterprises** and **operators**.


## Enterprises and operators will benefit from 5G and eSIM

Thanks to network slicing, private networks are easier to set up with 5G.

It is a feature of 5G that allows carriers to break up their networks into different slices, or "micro-networks." They are then dedicated to specific customers and can be tailored to meet their needs. Each "slice" can have its own network environment, with different bandwidth and latency requirements.

5G private networks bring control and security to enterprises allowing their workers to connect with the latest smartphones, tablets and other must-have connected devices.

For example, 5G private networks give connected airports complete control over their network and data. Indeed network slicing solutions allow keeping all connected devices securely linked between them. 5G can support a vast number of connected devices when there is a strong demand for connectivity.

Private networks also allow global operators to offer their customers the fastest eSIM data services.


# [Consumer eSIM activation](https://www.idemia.com/insights/13-questions-about-esim)

eSIM activation is the process of downloading a mobile operator's profile onto an embedded SIM in a device. There are four methods for eSIM activation:

1. **GSMA eSIM Discovery**: The most user-friendly method where the mobile operator sends the eUICC identity (EID) to the subscription management server (SM-DP+), which informs GSMA eSIM Discovery to download the eSIM profile onto the device automatically.
2. **eSIM activation via a default SM-DP+**: If a mobile operator partners with a device manufacturer, the device connects to the SM-DP+, which downloads the eSIM profile onto the device seamlessly, requiring no action from the user.
3. **eSIM activation via a unique QR code:** The user is provided with a specific QR code that contains the SM-DP+ URL, which triggers the download of the eSIM profile onto the device once scanned with the eSIM device.
4. **eSIM activation via a group QR code:** Mobile operators can use a single QR code to onboard groups of subscribers for marketing campaigns or to acquire customers on the move.


# [\*\*How to Verify Profiles on eSIM Devices](https://www.comprion.com/testability/news-detail/how-to-verify-profiles-on-esim-devices/)?\*\*

The article discusses the challenge of installing new profiles on eSIMs of various consumer devices and the difficulties in ensuring proper installation.

The COMPRION eUICC Profile Manager is presented as a solution to avoid additional setup tasks and to directly connect to one's own network to scan the file structure created on the eSIM during profile installation and compare it with the original profile file.

**The steps for verifying profiles using eUICC Profile Manager include**

1. connecting to the network,
2. scanning the file structure of the installed profile on the device,
3. and selecting the original profile file for comparison.

The tool highlights any differences between the two file trees and identifies whether a service deactivation is intended behavior or an error. The benefits of using eUICC Profile Manager include avoiding the hassle of dealing with different devices, additional app handling, and configuration issues.


# GSMA Important Standards

1. **GSMA SGP.02:** This standard defines the architecture and framework for eSIM, including the security mechanisms required to ensure that the eSIM and its associated data are secure and protected from unauthorized access.
2. **GSMA SGP.21:** This standard defines the technical specifications for the eSIM profile and the processes used for profile management.
3. **GSMA SGP.01:** This standard defines the overall requirements for eSIM, including hardware and software requirements, interoperability standards, and protocols for communication between the eSIM and the network.
4. **ISO/IEC 7816:** This standard defines the physical and logical characteristics of the Integrated Circuit Card (ICC) used in eSIMs.
5. **ETSI TS 102 221:** This standard defines the remote provisioning architecture for eSIMs and the procedures for downloading and installing eSIM profiles.
6. **ETSI TS 103 383:** This standard defines the security mechanisms required to ensure the authenticity and confidentiality of eSIM profiles during the download and installation process.

Following these standards ensures that the eSIM is interoperable with other eSIMs and networks, and that the eSIM and its associated data are secure and protected from unauthorized access.


## Use of blockchain technology for integrity and privacy of the eSIM data

Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and secure way of storing and managing data. By using a blockchain-based solution, the eSIM data can be stored and managed in a distributed ledger, which is resistant to tampering and data breaches.

In a blockchain-based eSIM solution, each eSIM can be represented as a unique digital asset on the blockchain. The unique ID of the eSIM can be linked to the user's crypto wallets, enabling them to access applications and services using their fingerprints.

The cryptographic identity services provided by the eSIM can be backed by zero-knowledge proofs, which allow for the privacy of the user's data. Zero-knowledge proofs enable the verification of data without the need to reveal the actual data itself.

In a blockchain-based eSIM solution, the network of nodes validates and records all transactions related to the eSIM data. This ensures the integrity of the data and prevents any unauthorized modifications or tampering.

Moreover, blockchain technology allows for smart contract implementation, which can automate the management and provisioning of eSIMs. Smart contracts can be used to set conditions for the eSIM data to be provisioned, de-provisioned, or updated, enabling the secure remote management of the eSIM data by the network operator.

Overall, a blockchain-based eSIM solution can provide a secure and decentralized way of managing eSIM data, ensuring the privacy and integrity of the user's data, and enabling remote management of the eSIMs by the network operator.


## Zero Knowledge Proof

Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a method of proving the possession of certain information, such as a private key, without revealing that information, or any other information beyond the fact that the information exists and is held by the prover. In other words, a ZKP allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the fact that the statement is true. ZKP protocols are used in various applications, including secure multiparty computations, digital rights management, and blockchain technology.

## How zero-knowledge proofs can provide a higher level of security for user data

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be used in various ways to enhance the security and privacy of the proposed blockchain-powered eSIM solution. Main use cases identified so far:


### Authenticating the eSIM:

**When is eSIM authentication needed?**

eSIM authentication is required whenever a device attempts to connect to the mobile network or interact with services that rely on eSIM credentials. This authentication process should occur at various stages, such as initial setup, network registration, and service access. By enforcing authentication at these points, the system ensures that only authorized eSIMs can participate, protecting users from potential security risks and fraudulent activities.

**Traditional way of eSIM authentication:** In traditional systems, eSIM authentication is typically performed using cryptographic methods like public-key infrastructure (PKI) or certificate-based authentication. Here's how it works:

- During the eSIM setup process, the eSIM is provisioned with a unique digital certificate containing its public key and other identification information.
- When the device attempts to connect to the mobile network, it presents its digital certificate to the network's authentication server.
- The server verifies the certificate's authenticity and validity using a certificate authority (CA) or a certificate revocation list (CRL).
- If the certificate is valid, the server allows the eSIM to connect to the network, and subsequent communications can be encrypted using the eSIM's public and private keys.

**Using ZK:**

eSIM authentication using Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), We need to establish a ZKP-based mechanism that ensures the authenticity of the eSIM without revealing the eSIM's private key or any other sensitive information. This approach can provide an additional layer of security and privacy. Here's an improved eSIM authentication process using ZKPs:

1. **ZKP-based eSIM Setup Process:** Instead of relying solely on a digital certificate for eSIM setup, the eSIM can now create a ZK proof to demonstrate possession of its private key without revealing the key itself. This proof can be generated during the eSIM setup process and stored securely on the device.

2. **Device Connection with ZKP Authentication:** When the device attempts to connect to the mobile network, it presents its digital certificate along with the ZK proof to the network's authentication server.

3. **ZKP Verification:** The authentication server performs the following verification steps:

   - It checks the validity of the digital certificate using the traditional certificate-based method to ensure the eSIM is authorized to connect.
   - It then verifies the ZK proof presented by the eSIM. The ZK proof confirms that the eSIM possesses the private key corresponding to the public key in the digital certificate without actually disclosing the private key itself.

4. **Secure Connection and Communication:** If both the digital certificate and the ZK proof are valid, the authentication server allows the eSIM to connect to the network securely. Subsequent communications between the eSIM and the network can be encrypted using the traditional public-key encryption, ensuring confidentiality.

**By incorporating ZKPs into the eSIM authentication process, we achieve the following advantages:**

- **Privacy-Preserving Authentication:** The ZKP-based authentication ensures that the eSIM's private key remains confidential and is never exposed during the authentication process. This enhances the overall privacy of the eSIM user.
- **Fraud Prevention:** The combination of traditional certificate-based authentication and ZKP-based proof makes it harder for attackers to impersonate an eSIM since they cannot forge the ZK proof without access to the actual private key.
- **Robust Security:** By using both the traditional and ZKP-based methods, the authentication process becomes more robust and resistant to potential attacks compared to relying solely on digital certificates.
- **Improved Trust Model:** The introduction of ZKPs enhances the trust model, as the eSIM can now be authenticated without the network or authentication server having full access to its private key. This distributed trust model adds an extra layer of security.

While implementing ZKPs in eSIM authentication adds computational overhead, advancements in ZKP protocols and optimizations can mitigate this issue.


### Proving ownership of the eSIM:

**When is proving eSIM ownership without disclosing personal information necessary?** Privacy-preserving ownership proofs are necessary whenever a user needs to access services or perform actions that require verifying their ownership of the eSIM. This could include accessing private accounts, making secure transactions, or interacting with applications that rely on eSIM ownership for authorization. By using ZKPs for ownership proofs, users can confidently engage in these activities while maintaining their privacy.

**Traditional way of users proving ownership of their eSIM without disclosing identity or personal information:**

In traditional systems, user ownership of the eSIM is often validated through standard username-password or PIN-based authentication. The process usually goes like this:

- During eSIM setup, the user creates an account with the service provider or mobile carrier and sets up a username or email as an identifier.
- The user is required to set a password or PIN to protect their account.
- When the user wants to prove ownership of the eSIM, they provide their username (or email) and password or PIN during the authentication process.
- The service provider or carrier compares the provided credentials with the stored ones in their database to authenticate the user's ownership.

\<aside> 💡 This traditional method has several drawbacks, such as the need to store user data on centralized servers, which can be vulnerable to data breaches and expose users' identity and personal information.

\</aside>

**Using ZK:**

To enhance the way users prove ownership of their eSIM without disclosing identity or personal information, we can employ Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to achieve privacy-preserving authentication. Here's an improved method using ZKPs:

1. **ZKP-based Ownership Proof Setup:** During eSIM setup, the user generates a cryptographic key pair, consisting of a public key and a private key. The private key is securely stored on the user's device, while the public key is registered with the service provider or mobile carrier.

2. **Initiating ZKP-based Authentication:** When the user wants to prove ownership of the eSIM, they initiate a ZKP-based authentication process with the service provider.

3. **ZKP Authentication Protocol:** The ZKP authentication protocol involves a series of interactions between the user's device (prover) and the service provider's authentication server (verifier).

   a. The prover generates a ZK proof demonstrating that it possesses the private key corresponding to the registered public key without revealing the private key itself or any other personal information.

   b. The prover sends the ZK proof to the verifier (service provider).

   c. The verifier receives the ZK proof and verifies its validity without gaining any knowledge of the prover's private key or any other sensitive data.

4. **Successful Authentication:** If the ZK proof is valid, the service provider can be confident that the user owns the eSIM without knowing the user's actual identity or any personal information. The user is granted access to the eSIM services without the need to disclose sensitive data.

**Advantages of ZKP-based eSIM Ownership Proof:**

- **Privacy-Preserving:** ZKPs ensure that the user's identity and personal information remain undisclosed during the authentication process, enhancing privacy and protecting the user from potential data breaches.
- **Decentralized Trust:** The use of ZKPs in ownership proof shifts the trust model from centralized servers to a more decentralized and distributed approach. The service provider can validate the user's ownership without relying on the disclosure of sensitive data.
- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Since the user's private key is never exposed, the risk of attacks targeting the disclosure of private information is significantly reduced.
- **Resilience to Credential Reuse:** Traditional username-password or PIN-based systems are susceptible to credential reuse attacks, where attackers exploit reused credentials from other services. ZKPs provide better resilience against such attacks since the eSIM ownership proof relies on a unique cryptographic key pair.

Here, it's essential to consider the computational overhead associated with ZKPs. To ensure practicality, optimizations and efficient ZKP protocols should be employed to minimize the computation burden on resource-constrained devices like eSIMs.


### Secure communication:

**When is verification of user requests without content exposure required?**

Secure verification of user requests without content exposure is essential for various scenarios, including secure communication with the eSIM for tasks such as encryption, decryption, digital signatures, or access to sensitive information. Whenever the eSIM needs to validate user commands or data exchanges, ZKPs can be employed to ensure privacy and security during the verification process.

**Traditional way of eSIM verifying the legitimacy of the user's requests or commands without knowing the actual content being transmitted:**

In traditional systems, this type of verification is challenging to achieve without additional secure elements like hardware security modules (HSMs) or relying on the user to encrypt the content themselves. However, here is an example of a method that attempts to achieve limited verification:

- The eSIM generates a cryptographic hash of the content being transmitted (e.g., a request or command) without knowing the actual content itself.
- This hash is sent along with the request to the eSIM.
- The eSIM, having its pre-shared key or secret, can recreate the hash of the received content and compare it with the hash sent by the user.
- If the hashes match, the eSIM assumes the content is legitimate without actually knowing its full details.

This traditional approach still requires some level of trust between the user and the eSIM, and it lacks the robustness and privacy guarantees.

**Using ZK:**

To improve the way of eSIM verifying the legitimacy of the user's requests or commands without knowing the actual content being transmitted, we can enhance the traditional approach with Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). By utilizing ZKPs, we can achieve stronger security and privacy guarantees. Here's an improved method using ZKPs:

1. **ZKP-based Verification Setup:** During the eSIM setup process, the eSIM and the user mutually establish a ZK authentication protocol that will be used for verifying the legitimacy of the user's requests or commands without revealing the content.

2. **Initiating ZKP-based Verification:** When the user wants to send a request or command to the eSIM, they initiate the ZKP-based verification process.

3. **ZKP Verification Protocol:** The ZKP verification protocol involves a series of interactions between the user (prover) and the eSIM (verifier).

   a. The prover generates a ZK proof demonstrating that the request or command they are sending satisfies certain conditions without revealing the actual content itself.

   b. The prover sends the ZK proof along with the request or command to the eSIM.

   c. The eSIM receives the ZK proof and verifies its validity without gaining any knowledge of the actual content.

4. **Secure Execution of Request or Command:** If the ZK proof is valid, the eSIM can be confident that the request or command sent by the user satisfies the required conditions without knowing the specific details of the content. As a result, the eSIM can securely execute the request or command.

**Advantages of ZKP-based eSIM Verification:**

- **Privacy-Preserving:** ZKPs ensure that the eSIM does not gain access to the actual content being transmitted, enhancing privacy and protecting sensitive data from being revealed to the eSIM.
- **Stronger Security:** ZKPs provide a higher level of security compared to traditional cryptographic hashing methods. The ZKP protocol ensures that the request or command meets specific criteria without exposing the actual content, preventing unauthorized or malicious commands.
- **Reduced Trust Requirements:** With ZKPs, the eSIM no longer needs to rely solely on the trustworthiness of the user's pre-shared key or secret. The ZKP-based verification allows the eSIM to validate the legitimacy of the request or command without needing to trust the user's secret completely.
- **Enhanced Robustness:** ZKPs offer a more robust and tamper-resistant way to verify the legitimacy of user requests or commands, reducing the risk of potential attacks on the verification process.

Again, implementing ZKPs requires careful consideration of the computational overhead and efficiency, especially on resource-constrained devices like eSIMs.


### Zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be useful in enhancing the security and privacy of traditional SIM cards by enabling users to prove their identity or access rights to the network without revealing any of their private information.

Zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be useful in enhancing the security and privacy of traditional SIM cards by enabling users to prove their identity or access rights to the network without revealing any of their private information.

Additionally, ZKPs could be used to securely authenticate users to the network without revealing their personal identification or location data. This could enhance the privacy of the user and protect against unauthorized access to their personal information.

Moreover, ZKPs could be used to enable secure communication between two parties without revealing the content of the communication to any third party. This could be useful for protecting the privacy of text messages, voice calls or other sensitive data transmitted through the SIM card.

Overall, ZKPs offer a promising way to enhance the security and privacy of traditional SIM cards, which could improve the trust and confidence of users in their mobile networks.

However, it is important to note that implementing ZKPs in SIM cards may require significant changes to existing systems and infrastructure, which can be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, ZKPs are not a foolproof solution, and there is always a risk of vulnerabilities or flaws in the underlying cryptographic algorithms or implementations.

To build a zero-knowledge (zk) circuit for a blockchain-powered eSIM solution that stores sensitive information such as user identity, location and phone number, network authorization data, personal security keys, contact lists, and stored text messages, the following standard steps can be followed:

1. Identify the data that needs to be stored on the blockchain: This includes the data types and their format. For example, user identity may include name, address, and date of birth, while location data may include latitude and longitude coordinates.
2. Determine the level of privacy required: For sensitive data such as user identity, personal security keys, and stored text messages, a higher level of privacy may be required. This means that the zk circuit needs to be designed to ensure that this information is kept private and secure.
3. Design the zk circuit: The zk circuit needs to be designed to ensure that it is secure, private, and efficient. This includes designing the circuit to handle the data types and formats identified in step 1, ensuring that the circuit can handle the required level of privacy, and optimizing the circuit for speed and efficiency.
4. Test the zk circuit: The zk circuit needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is working as intended. This includes testing the circuit with various inputs and data types, testing for security vulnerabilities, and ensuring that the circuit is efficient and fast.
5. Deploy the zk circuit on the blockchain: Once the zk circuit has been tested and is working as intended, it can be deployed on the blockchain. This allows the eSIM solution to store sensitive information securely and privately on the blockchain, where it can be accessed and verified as needed.

Overall, building a zk circuit for a blockchain-powered eSIM solution requires careful planning and design to ensure that the circuit is secure, private, and efficient, while also handling the sensitive information that needs to be stored.


### Using zk-SNARK

Designing the architecture of a ZK-SNARK implementation for a SIM card to prove all the information it stores without revealing it would involve several components. Here is a high-level overview of the architecture:

1. Circuit design: The first step is to design a circuit that represents all the information that a SIM card stores. This circuit should be designed in a way that allows it to prove the authenticity of the information without revealing it. The circuit can be designed using programming languages like C++, Python or Rust and libraries like libsnark, bellman or zokrates.
2. Prover and verifier modules: The next step is to implement the prover and verifier modules that will generate and verify the proofs respectively. These modules will use the circuit design to generate and verify the proofs. These modules can be implemented in the same programming languages as the circuit design.
3. Key generation: To generate the proving and verification keys, a trusted setup ceremony can be performed. This ceremony involves generating the keys on a trusted system and distributing them to the parties involved in the implementation. The proving key is used by the prover module to generate the proofs, while the verification key is used by the verifier module to verify the proofs.
4. Integration with SIM card: Once the circuit design and the prover and verifier modules are implemented, they need to be integrated with the SIM card. This can be done using standard SIM card programming languages like Java Card or Global Platform.
5. Deployment and testing: After the integration is complete, the implementation needs to be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. The implementation can be tested using simulation tools or actual SIM card devices.

In terms of the specific tools and languages that can be used, here are some suggestions:

- Circuit design: C++, Python, Rust, libsnark, bellman, zokrates.
- Prover and verifier modules: C++, Python, Rust.

4. Privacy: ZK-SNARKs allow users to prove the correctness of a statement without revealing any information about the inputs. This provides a high level of privacy, which is critical for applications such as SIM cards, where protecting personal information is paramount.

Overall, ZK-SNARKs offer several advantages that make them an excellent choice for implementing zero-knowledge proofs in applications such as SIM cards. While there may be other algorithms that could be used for this purpose, ZK-SNARKs are widely regarded as the most efficient, secure, and versatile option available.


## Below toggles explains the improvements in telecom protocols using ZKPs

### Protocols is telecom that can be improved with ZKP and how?

There are several protocols in telecom that can be improved with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), here are some examples:

1. Authentication and Authorization: ZKPs can be used to prove identity or access rights to the network without revealing any personal information. For example, in the 5G network, ZKPs can be used to provide secure authentication and authorization of devices without disclosing the device's identity or location. This can protect against unauthorized access to user data and enhance privacy.
2. Billing and Charging: ZKPs can be used to enable secure billing and charging of telecom services without revealing any personal information. For example, in the context of mobile payments, ZKPs can be used to prove the ownership of a mobile wallet without disclosing the owner's identity or transaction details. This can prevent fraud and enhance privacy.
3. Location Tracking: ZKPs can be used to enable secure location tracking of mobile devices without revealing the device's location to third parties. For example, in the context of emergency services, ZKPs can be used to provide secure location tracking of a device without disclosing the device's location to unauthorized parties. This can enhance privacy and security.
4. Network Optimization: ZKPs can be used to enable secure sharing of network data between telecom operators without disclosing any sensitive information. For example, in the context of network optimization, ZKPs can be used to share network statistics between operators without revealing any personal information or specific user behavior. This can enhance network performance while preserving privacy.

Overall, ZKPs offer a promising way to enhance the security and privacy of various protocols in telecom. By leveraging ZKPs, telecom operators can provide more secure and private services while protecting against fraud and unauthorized access to user data.

- **Improvements in Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES) using ZKPs.**

  Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can potentially help in advancing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES) by improving their security and privacy.

  ZKPs allow a prover to convince a verifier of the truth of a statement without revealing any additional information beyond the fact that the statement is true. In the context of cryptography, ZKPs can be used to prove that certain computations were performed correctly or that certain data satisfies certain conditions, without revealing the actual computation or data.

  For AES and DES, ZKPs can be used to prove that the encryption or decryption of a message was performed correctly, without revealing the encryption key or the plaintext message. This can be useful in situations where the confidentiality of the encryption key or the plaintext message must be maintained, but it is still necessary to prove that the encryption or decryption was performed correctly.

  Additionally, ZKPs can also be used to prove that certain cryptographic primitives, such as hash functions or symmetric encryption algorithms, are secure and resistant to attacks. This can be useful in verifying the security of AES and DES, as well as in developing new cryptographic primitives that are more secure and efficient than existing ones.

  In summary, ZKPs can potentially help in advancing AES and DES by improving their security and privacy, as well as in verifying the security of cryptographic primitives used in these algorithms.

- **Improvements in Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) using ZKPs.**

  GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is a widely used mobile communication standard that provides voice and data services to mobile devices.

  Currently, GSM uses a challenge-response auth mechanism, where the network sends a challenge to the mobile device, and the mobile device responds with a value calculated using a secret key. This mechanism is vulnerable to attacks such as eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attack

  One way that ZKP could be used to improve GSM is to enhance the security of the authentication process between the mobile device and the network.

  ZKP could be used to create a more secure authentication mechanism by allowing the mobile device to prove to the network that it possesses the secret key without revealing the key itself.

  In this scheme, the network would send a random challenge to the mobile device, and the mobile device would use the secret key to generate a response.

  Instead of sending the response directly to the network, the mobile device would use a ZKP to prove to the network that it possesses the secret key without revealing the key itself.

  Another potential use of ZKP in GSM is to enhance the privacy of user data. With traditional auth mechanisms, the network knows the identity of the user and can link their activity to their identity.

  By using ZKP, the user could prove their identity without revealing it to the network, thus providing an extra layer of privacy.

  Implementing ZKP in GSM would require significant changes to the existing infrastructure, so it may take some time before we see this technology being used in practice.

- **Improvements in Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol using ZKPs.**

  The Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol is a security protocol used in cellular networks to authenticate users and establish secure communication channels. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be used to improve the security and privacy of the AKA protocol in several ways:

  1. Enhancing User Privacy: ZKPs can be used to verify user identities without revealing any additional information about the user, beyond the fact that the user has the necessary credentials to access the network. This can help protect user privacy by preventing the disclosure of unnecessary personal information.
  2. Mitigating Replay Attacks: Replay attacks occur when an attacker intercepts and retransmits previously sent messages, in order to gain unauthorized access to the network. ZKPs can be used to prevent replay attacks by including a time stamp in the message, which is then verified using a ZKP to ensure that the message is current and has not been previously transmitted.
  3. Improving Key Agreement: ZKPs can be used to establish shared secret keys between users and the network, without revealing the actual keys themselves. This can improve the security of the key agreement process, as it prevents the interception of the keys by attackers.
  4. Protecting Against Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Man-in-the-middle attacks occur when an attacker intercepts and modifies messages between two parties, in order to gain access to the network. ZKPs can be used to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks by providing a secure channel for verifying the identities of the parties involved in the communication.

  Overall, the use of ZKPs in the AKA protocol can enhance the security and privacy of cellular networks, by mitigating various types of attacks and improving the key agreement process. However, the implementation of ZKPs can also introduce additional computational overhead and complexity, which must be carefully balanced against the benefits of increased security and privacy.

- **Drawbacks of all**

  Some potential drawbacks for each of the options listed if they were not suitable for a zk circuit for a blockchain-powered eSIM solution:

  1. Halo2-ce: While Halo2-ce is designed to handle complex computations, it may not be the best option for extremely large computations that involve sensitive data, as it may not be scalable enough to handle them. Additionally, it may not be the best option if a simpler, more straightforward circuit design is preferred.
  2. SNARK: While SNARKs are useful for privacy-preserving transactions and other applications, they can be computationally expensive and may not be suitable for large computations that involve sensitive data. Additionally, they may not be the best option if transparency and audibility are important.
  3. STARK: STARKs are designed to be more transparent and auditable than SNARKs, but they can also be computationally expensive and may not be suitable for large computations that involve sensitive data. Additionally, they may not be the best option if scalability is important.
  4. Recursive SNARK: Recursive SNARKs can be more scalable than other types of SNARKs, but they may still be computationally expensive and may not be suitable for extremely large computations that involve sensitive data.
  5. Custom gates: Custom gates can help optimize circuit design, but they may also introduce additional complexity and may not be suitable for circuits that require a simpler design.
  6. Lookup argument: Lookup arguments can speed up the verification process, but they may not be suitable for circuits that require a high degree of privacy and security, as the precomputed values could potentially be used to reverse-engineer the circuit.
  7. zk Cross Chain Bridge: zk Cross Chain Bridges are useful for transferring assets or data between different blockchains, but they may not be suitable for circuits that require a high degree of privacy and security, as the transfer could potentially be traced or intercepted.
  8. Arithmetic and ECC SNARK: Arithmetic and ECC SNARKs can provide stronger security and privacy guarantees, but they can also be computationally expensive and may not be suitable for large computations that involve sensitive data.
  9. zkEVM: zkEVM is useful for privacy-preserving smart contract execution, but it may not be suitable for circuits that require a high degree of privacy and security, as the inputs and outputs of the smart contract could potentially be traced or intercepted.

  Each of these options has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the suitability of each option will depend on the specific application and requirements. It's important to carefully consider these factors when choosing a zk circuit for a blockchain-powered eSIM solution to store sensitive information.

- **Building with Halo2-ce**

  Halo2-ce is a tool for building zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) circuits in Rust programming language. It allows for the creation of circuits that are efficient, scalable, and secure. Halo2-ce has been designed to support complex computations, which makes it ideal for building a circuit for an eSIM solution that stores sensitive information.

  Moreover, Halo2-ce has a robust community, documentation and support, which makes it easier to develop, debug, and maintain the circuits.

  While the other options such as SNARK, STARK, Recursive SNARK, Custom Gates, Lookup Argument, zk Cross Chain Bridge, Arithmetic and ECC SNARK, and zkEVM also have their strengths, they may not be the best fit for an eSIM solution, especially in terms of the complexity of computation and the ability to handle sensitive data. Therefore, Halo2-ce would be the most suitable option.

3. Roaming: The GSMA is examining the potential of blockchain to simplify and streamline the process of roaming, where mobile customers use their devices when traveling outside of their home country. Blockchain can provide a secure and transparent platform for tracking and settling roaming charges between operators.
4. Supply Chain: The GSMA is looking at the use of blockchain to improve supply chain visibility and traceability, enabling mobile operators to track the origin and authenticity of devices and components.

The GSMA's work on blockchain is helping to drive innovation and growth in this area, and to ensure that blockchain is used in a way that is secure, transparent, and benefits all stakeholders in the mobile industry.


### On Blockchain powered eSIM

The GSMA is actively exploring the potential for using blockchain technology to power eSIMs. The aim is to create a secure, decentralized system for managing and storing eSIM information, enabling mobile operators to manage eSIMs remotely and in real-time.

One of the main benefits of using blockchain for eSIMs is increased security. By using blockchain's distributed ledger technology, the eSIM data can be securely stored and managed, with all changes and updates recorded on the blockchain. This makes it much more difficult for the information to be altered or tampered with, helping to ensure the privacy and security of the subscriber's data.

Another potential benefit of using blockchain for eSIMs is increased flexibility. With blockchain, eSIM information can be managed remotely, enabling operators to easily switch subscribers to different plans or networks, or add new profiles to the eSIM, all without the need for a physical SIM card.

The GSMA's work on blockchain-powered eSIMs is helping to drive innovation and growth in this area, and to ensure that blockchain is used in a way that is secure, transparent, and benefits all stakeholders in the mobile industry. The goal is to create a robust and scalable infrastructure for the management of eSIMs, which can be easily integrated into existing mobile networks and devices, and provide a secure platform for the management of subscriber data.


### Guidance

The GSMA's technical specifications and guidelines for the use of eSIMs in mobile devices and networks are known as the "Embedded SIM Specification." The aim of the specification is to provide a common technical framework for the implementation of eSIMs in the mobile industry, helping to ensure compatibility and interoperability between different eSIM solutions.

The specification covers a range of technical aspects of eSIMs, including:

1. Security: The specification defines the security requirements for eSIMs, including the protection of the eSIM's unique identities and the protection of sensitive data such as subscriber profiles.
2. Profile Management: The specification defines the process for managing the eSIM profiles, including how new profiles can be added, deleted, or updated.
3. Remote Provisioning: The specification outlines the process for remotely provisioning the eSIMs, enabling operators to manage the eSIM profiles remotely and in real-time.
4. Physical Characteristics: The specification outlines the physical requirements for the eSIM, including its size, form factor, and electrical interface.
5. Technical Interfaces: The specification defines the technical interfaces between the eSIM and other components in the mobile device and network, including the SIM card interface, the eUICC (Embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card) interface, and the management interface.

These technical specifications and guidelines help to ensure that eSIMs are implemented in a consistent and interoperable manner, which is important for the growth and success of the eSIM market. The GSMA continues to update and evolve the Embedded SIM Specification to ensure it stays up-to-date with the latest developments and technologies in the mobile industry.

### [GSMA eSIM Whitepaper](https://www.gsma.com/esim/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/esim-whitepaper.pdf)

_**The eSIM (embedded SIM) is a new type of SIM card that is integrated into devices and cannot be physically removed or swapped like a traditional SIM card. The GSMA (Groupe Speciale Mobile Association) is an industry organization that represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide. In 2016, the GSMA published a whitepaper titled "eSIM for Consumer Devices," which explains the benefits of eSIM technology and its potential impact on the mobile industry.**_

This whitepaper explains that eSIMs offer several advantages over traditional SIM cards, such as:

1. Greater flexibility: eSIMs can be programmed over-the-air, meaning that consumers can switch between mobile network operators without needing to physically change their SIM card.
2. Better user experience: eSIMs eliminate the need for consumers to wait for a physical SIM card to be delivered or go to a store to purchase one. This makes it easier for users to get connected to mobile networks.
3. Improved security: eSIMs can be securely provisioned with operator-specific credentials, reducing the risk of SIM card fraud.
4. More efficient device design: eSIMs take up less space in devices than traditional SIM cards, which can allow for more efficient device designs.

This whitepaper also discusses some of the challenges that need to be addressed for eSIM technology to become widely adopted. For example, there is a need for standardized methods of provisioning and managing eSIMs, and there are regulatory considerations that need to be addressed.

Overall, the eSIM whitepaper by GSMA provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits and challenges of eSIM technology and is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about this emerging technology.


### Let’s Begin!

The ubiquitous SIM card has played a fundamental role in mobile telecommunications for over 25 years. It is recognised by end users and provides a secure means for authenticating devices onto networks, all inside a removable “Secure Element”, which is easily transferrable between mobile devices.

> _**The GSMA has defined a radical new way to load it into devices. Now the SIM may be securely downloaded into a ‘Secure Element’ that can be permanently embedded inside any type of device.**_


### The change from the Removable SIM to an eSIM provides benefits for many players:

- _**For everyone, eSIM provides an equivalent level of security as the removable SIM card.**_ This is vital as it is the subscription credentials stored on the SIM card that enable secure and private access to mobile networks. It also supports the integrity of the billing process, especially in roaming scenarios.
- _**For the device end user,**_ eSIM enables simplified management of subscriptions and connections. End users will no longer have to manage several SIM cards.
- _**For organisations,**_ eSIM enables remote management of subscriptions. This is a significant benefit where devices are not managed by the end user or are not be readily accessible (for example due to operational scale, making individual device management cost prohibitive). This enables pioneering categories of connected devices.
- _**For distributors,**_ simplified logistics are possible, customisation for specific operators or regions may be reduced.
- _**Operators**_ will have simpler means to expand their businesses into emerging markets, for example, automotive, wearables and consumer electronics. SIM card distribution costs will be eliminated, and eSIMs will enable new distribution models for devices and for marketing of subscriptions:
- _**Device Manufacturers,**_ can exploit the reduced space within their products to make smaller devices. Their products could also be made more tolerant to environmental factors such as dampness, temperature and vibration as they can be hermetically (completely airtight) sealed. Manufacturers can also leverage eSIMs to optimise supply chain processes.


### How it works

eSIM is a technology that allows mobile devices to connect to a mobile network without a physical SIM card. The SIM credentials are pre-installed directly into the device during manufacturing and can be remotely provisioned and managed by the network operator over the internet. The device contacts the remote subscription management platform (SM-DP+) server to download and install the operator profile, containing the SIM credentials required for network connection. The SM-DP+ server is managed by the network operator and can remotely provision and de-provision SIM profiles, manage SIM updates and modifications, and monitor SIM usage and performance. eSIM technology simplifies SIM logistics and switching between different operator profiles, is smaller in size, and ideal for small devices.

**eSIM is a technology that extends the reach of traditional SIM cards to any location where the device can be reached over the internet. This is done by providing secure facilities for the manufacture, software loading and operator credentials of eSIMs.**

**eSIM protocols provide security and integrity for data transfer. However, the distribution channels for SIM cards also contain 'business logic' which is required by various service models.**

**_The GSMA has created solutions suited to different types of channels, including the_ Consumer solution for the 'direct to consumer' channel**

_**and the**_

__M2M solution for the 'business to business to consumer' channels_,_\*\*

_**specifically in the IoT market.**_

**The Consumer solution requires a high degree of end user interaction, while the M2M solution manages all SIM provisioning operations remotely.**


### Security and Encryption mechanisms in traditional SIM cards

Traditional SIM cards use various security and encryption mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of the SIM card and the mobile network communication.

One of the main security mechanisms used in traditional SIM cards is the use of encryption algorithms such as _**Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES)**_ to secure the SIM card's data and communication with the network.

Another important security mechanism is the use of secure authentication protocols such as the _**Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol**_, which authenticates the SIM card and ensures that only authorized devices can connect to the network.

The SIM card's storage is also protected by various security measures, including PIN and PUK codes, which prevent unauthorized access to the SIM card's data.

Finally, traditional SIM cards are manufactured and managed in secure facilities that follow strict security protocols and procedures to ensure the integrity of the SIM card's data and operation.


### Today’s SIM Card

- A SIM card is a small device that stores a user's subscription information for accessing a mobile network.
- Users receive a SIM card from their chosen mobile network operator when they sign up for services.
- The SIM card contains the user's phone number and network access credentials.
- The user inserts the SIM card into their mobile device to connect to the operator's network and use mobile services.
- If the user wants to switch to a different network operator, they must sign up for new services and receive a new SIM card with different subscription information.
- The user must physically swap out the old SIM card with the new one to connect to the new operator's network.
- SIM cards provide a level of security by authenticating the device on the network and protecting the user's personal information.
- Some SIM cards can store multiple profiles, allowing users to switch between different networks or services without physically swapping SIM cards.
- Other advanced SIM cards can also store payment information and act as a mobile wallet for making payments.


## Remote SIM Provisioning

- Remote SIM Provisioning eliminates the use of traditional SIM cards in mobile devices.
- Instead, an embedded SIM (eUICC) is used, which can accommodate multiple SIM profiles.
- To set up mobile services, the end user receives instructions on how to connect their device to the operator's Remote SIM Provisioning system, typically via a QR code.
- The device securely downloads a SIM profile from the system, which allows it to connect to the operator's network.
- To switch to a different operator, the end user can receive a QR code from the new operator and scan it to download the new profile.
- With Remote SIM Provisioning, the end user can switch between profiles to connect their device to whichever operator's network they choose.
- Other methods for configuring the eSIM solution within a device include pre-configured devices, use of Subscription Manager-Discovery Server, and companion devices.


## Why are there two Solutions for Remote SIM Provisioning?

Remote SIM Provisioning (RSP) is the process of remotely managing and updating a SIM card in a mobile device without requiring physical access to the device. The GSMA has developed two different RSP solutions - one for M2M (machine-to-machine) devices and one for Consumer devices.

_**The reason for two different solutions is the fundamental difference in the direction of control.**_

**In the M2M solution**, the mobile device is **managed by the operator backend infrastructure, without any local human control of connectivity.** This means that the operator selects the Profiles to be downloaded and enables/disables them depending on factors such as the country the device is operating in. On the other hand, **the Consumer solution** requires that **all subscription Profile operations are under end-user control, or at least subject to end-user permission.** This is done through an end-user interface on the device.

Despite the differences in control, **both solutions share some common features**.

- _Both use a network-domain Remote SIM Provisioning system (SM-DP/SM-DP+) and a secure element within the mobile device for the storage, management, and operation of Profiles (eUICC)._
- _They also use Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based cryptography, and require a GSMA Certificate Issuer (CI) that issues digital certificates to enable entities to securely communicate with each other._

However, **there are also unique features to each solution.**

- _In the_ **M2M solution**\*, everything is remotely managed, requiring no human interaction. The eUICC connects to the SM-SR using Bearer Independent Protocol (BIP) and the SM-SR acts as a gateway from the operator and SM-DP through to the eUICC. The M2M solution includes the SM-SR that is not required in the Consumer solution.\*
- _In contrast, the_ **Consumer solution** _has the LPA in the device (or eUICC) that assists with the download of Profiles and secures the end-user interface on the device that is used for local control. All Profile downloads use IP protocols, and where applicable use the greater capacity of the device TCP/IP stack to reduce the communication overhead. As messages cannot be pushed to the device and eUICC, there is a ‘Discovery Service’ that devices can check from anywhere, at any time, to see if there are any Profiles or management operations waiting to be downloaded from an SM-DP+._

Finally, **there are differences in compliance between the two solutions.**

While **the principles of compliance are similar for both**,

_The compliance process for Consumer solutions places greater emphasis on functional compliance, which has to be demonstrated before the eUICC manufacturer or Subscription Management platform provider can apply for a digital certificate from the GSMA Certificate Issuer. The compliance process is up and running for all Consumer solution product types, with a similar scheme now being considered for M2M to strengthen the entire ecosystem._


## The Profile

A Profile in the eSIM solution consists of the operator's subscription data, including their credentials and SIM-based applications. The eUICC is the secure element in the solution that can accommodate multiple Profiles.

Profiles are remotely downloaded over-the-air into the eUICC, and although the eUICC is an integral part of the device, the Profile remains the property of the operator as it contains items owned by them.

Interoperable Profiles stored on eUICCs have a similar content and structure to those installed on traditional SIMs. The SIMAlliance defines the interoperable description of these Profiles.


## M2M solution:

for the ‘business to business to consumer’ channels, this solution serves the needs of business to business customers, specifically in the Internet of Things (IoT) market.

The GSMA **M2M solution** was the first Remote SIM Provisioning solution developed. There were two reasons for this:

1. The M2M solution is simpler as end user interaction is not required, or desirable, in the business to business to consumer (B2B2C) segment, and
2. The immediate commercial need was for technical solutions that supported B2B2C deployments alongside regulatory requirements for the launch of services such as eCall.

**Main System Elements:** Remote SIM Provisioning for M2M utilises a server driven (push model) to provision and remotely manage operator Profiles. The solution is organised around 3 elements: the SM-DP (Subscription Manager - Data Preparation), the SM-SR (Subscription Manager - Secure Routing) and the eUICC.

**SM-DP** The SM-DP is responsible for preparing, storing and protecting operator Profiles (including the operator credentials). It also downloads and install Profiles onto the eUICC.

**SM-SR** The SM-SR is responsible for managing the status of Profiles on the eUICC (enable, disable, delete). It also secures the communications link between the eUICC and SM-DP for the delivery of operator Profiles.

**eUICC** The eUICC is a secure element that contains one or more subscription Profiles. Each Profile enables the eUICC to function in the same way as a removable SIM issued by the operator that created it. An eUICC may be built using any form factor from the traditional removable card to embedded formats soldered into devices.

**Compliance**

To ensure the security of the eSIM ecosystem, a set of criteria has been developed to demonstrate compliance with the core requirements. Compliance with the GSMA M2M specification requires verification of several factors.

- Firstly, **the eUICC security**, which references a Common Criteria Protection Profile, must be at the assurance level of EAL4+.
- Secondly, **production environment and process security** must be in place, which can be achieved via the GSMA's Security Accreditation Scheme: SAS-UP for eUICC personalisation or SAS-SM for Subscription Management platforms.
- Finally, **functional compliance** is required, which is based on the GSMA's test specification. GlobalPlatform has created and implemented a functional test and qualification programme for eUICCs based on the GSMA defined test cases.

Only eUICC manufacturers, and SM-SR and SM-DP hosting organisations that have successfully been accredited by the GSMA SAS can apply for the necessary certificates from the GSMA Certificate Issuer to participate in the GSMA approved ecosystem. Compliance with these standards helps to reassure all participants that the eSIM ecosystem is secure.


## Consumer Solution:

Consumer solution for the ‘direct to consumer’ channel, this solution is required where the end user (or consumer) has direct choice of the operator supplying connectivity. Consumer solutions require a high degree of end user interaction, with the principle that the end user is familiar with operating the end user interface and actively choosing their network connectivity provider. The Consumer solution also targets enterprises who use devices targeted to the consumer market.

The GSMA **Consumer solution** has been developed from the base provided by the M2M solution, plus consideration of requirements for end user-managed devices. This solution is required to manage use cases are more complex than the M2M solution. Consequentially, more features are required in the specification. In particular the Consumer solution manages end user interaction via the mobile device end user interface, and also supports standalone and companion device types.

**Main System Elements:**

The GSMA Remote SIM Provisioning Consumer solution follows a client driven (pull model) and enables control over remote provisioning and local management of operator Profiles by the end user of the device. The solution is organised around 4 elements: the SM-DP+ (Subscription Manager - Data Preparation +), the SM-DS (Subscription Manager - Discovery Server), the LPA (Local Profile Assistant) and the eUICC.

**SM-DP+** The SM-DP+ is responsible for the creation, download, remote management16 (enable, disable, update, delete) and the protection of operator credentials (the Profile). It is given the + designation as it encapsulates the functions of both the SM-DP and the SM-SR of the M2M solution. **LPA** The LPA (Local Profile Assistant) is a set of functions in the device responsible for providing the capability to download encrypted Profiles to the eUICC. It also presents the local management end user interface to the end user so they canmanage the status of Profiles on the eUICC17. The principal functions of the LPA may also be in built into the eUICC. **eUICC**

The eUICC in the Consumer solution serves the same high-level purpose as the eUICC in the M2M solution. Implementation is different to support the end user interaction within the Consumer solution. **SM-DS** The SM-DS provides a means for an SM-DP+ to reach the eUICC without having to know which network the device is connected to. This feature is important as devices can be connected using different access networks with different addresses. The SM-DS overcomes this by allowing SMDP+ to post alerts to a secure noticeboard and for devices to extract those alerts. It is used to notify the LPA when Profile data is available for download to the eUICC. Notifications are sent from the SM-DP+ to the SM-DS. The device LPA polls the SM-DS for notifications when required (supporting the “pull” model). Polling frequency is determined by the eUICC state and by end user actions.

**Compliance**

Compliance with the GSMA Consumer solution specification is crucial for entities that wish to participate in the GSMA-approved Consumer solution ecosystem. To be compliant, entities must verify three things: eUICC Security, Production Environment and Process Security, and Functional Compliance.

- The **eUICC** Security requirement uses the same mechanisms as the M2M specification, focusing initially only on a silicon-level Protection Profile (PP0084). A GSMA-specified Protection Profile to the level of EAL4+ is currently under development.
- The **Production Environment and Process Security** requirement uses the same security accreditation schemes as the M2M specification, namely the GSMA's Security Accreditation Scheme: SAS-UP or SAS-SM, depending on the Consumer solution entity type.
- For **Functional Compliance**, all Consumer solution entities must undergo functional test and certification programs based on GSMA test specification SGP.23. These programs have been established in partnership with GSMA by GlobalPlatform (for eUICC), Global Certification Forum, and PTCRB (for Consumer solution devices).

Once eUICC manufacturers, SM-DP+ and SM-DS hosting organizations successfully prove their compliance with both the security and functional requirements, they can apply for the necessary certificates from the GSMA Certificate Issuer to participate in the GSMA approved Consumer solution ecosystem.


## Compliant Devices and Platforms are Essential

**During their normal deployment processes, vendors and operators would expect to perform extensive interoperability and compatibility testing. In this case between, for example:**

- eUICC and the Subscription Management platforms (for example installed certificates, functional behaviour),
- eUICC and the device (for example the UICC Refresh command support is mandatory for both solutions),
- Device and the Subscription Management platforms (for Consumer solution only, with the LPA),
- Operator Profile and the targeted eUICC.

**Therefore, to minimise the need for repetitive interoperability testing, the various stakeholders looking to deploy Remote SIM Provisioning must check that all their suppliers have products satisfying the relevant GSMA product compliance process covering:**

- Product certification
- eUICC product security assurance
- Product site and data-centre accreditation according to the GSMA Security Accreditation Scheme (SAS)

**And subsequently perform:**

- Issuance of certificates by a GSMA Certificate Issuer for compliant products.


## Annex - Frequently Asked Questions

1. _**Can a device without a Profile connect to a mobile network?**_ A device without a Profile loaded and enabled may use a number of alternative methods to download a Profile. These include using a special purpose ‘Provisioning Profile’ to connect to a cellular network for both Consumer and M2M solutions, or for the Consumer solution only there is also the additional options of using a non-cellular network (e.g. WiFi) or a primary device with its own cellular connection.
2. _**What is a consumer device?**_ A ‘consumer device’ is considered to be any device where the consumer, device owner or end user has a direct contract or relationship with an operator of their choice to operate the device.
3. _**What is a Companion Device? And a Primary Device?**_ A Companion Device is a device that relies on the capabilities of a primary device for the purpose of Remote SIM Provisioning. A primary device is a device that can be used to provide capabilities (e.g.: touch screen keyboard, page-sized display) to a companion device for the purpose of Remote SIM Provisioning.
4. _**Will the traditional SIM card be phased out?**_ The use of the traditional SIM will very likely decrease over time based on the availability and penetration of devices supporting Remote SIM Provisioning.
5. _**Will Remote SIM Provisioning remove the need for international roaming?**_ Remote SIM Provisioning will not replace the roaming services provided by operators.
6. _**How much memory will be available in an eUICC and how many Profiles can be stored into it?**_ The memory of an eUICC can range from several KB to several MB. There is no specific limit on the number of Profiles that can be stored on an eUICC, this depends only on memory available and the size of Profiles. Operators could manage Profile sizes to fit them in the eUICC.
7. _**What is the ‘GSMA approved ecosystem’?**_ Both the Consumer and M2M solutions require trusted platforms to interoperate with each other. For both solutions the GSMA specifications define the platforms within this ecosystem, and the necessary conditions to be met by a platform to enter the ecosystem and thus interoperate.
8. _**How is it possible to check if a SM-DP/SM-DP+ is certified?**_ The SM-DP/SM-DP+ will be SAS certified according to the compliance process of the GSMA. The GSMA [website](https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/leadership/committees-and-groups/working-groups/fraud-security-group/security-accreditationscheme/sas-accredited-sites-list) lists all accredited sites. After a successful SAS certification, the SM-DP/SM-DP+ can apply to the CI to get a Certificate valid within the relevant ecosystem.
9. _**Will there be multiple CIs in the Consumer and/or M2M Architectures?**_ Consumer solution products: Currently the support of multiple CIs is ensured, but for the moment there is a single Root CI managed by GSMA and implemented by Digicert. M2M solution products: The support of multiple CIs is expected to be available with version 4.0 of the specification that should be delivered in 2018.
10. _**Where can the list of GSMA compliant products and vendors be found?**_ The list of SAS accredited sites can be found on the GSMA [website](https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/leadership/committees-and-groups/working-groups/fraud-security-group/security-accreditationscheme/sas-accredited-sites-list) and the list of GSMA Consumer solution compliant products can be found at the [InfoCentre](https://infocentre2.gsma.com/gp/og/STF/CRT/Pages/GSMA-RSP-Compliance-Products.aspx) which is for GSMA members only.
11. _**How can an operator be sure its Profile will work in a targeted eUICC?**_ Operators can define Profile configurations to optimise operation with different eUICCs embedded in devices. The GSMA Remote SIM Provisioning allows an ‘eligibility check’ of the eUICC and device capabilities to permit creation and download of an appropriate Profile. In addition, operators may use a specific Profile to provide specific services (examples include NFC, PKI) to their customer. Profiles should be created according to the SIMalliance Interoperable Profile package [specifications](http://simalliance.org/euicc/euicc-technical-releases/).
12. _**What is an activation voucher or activation code for Consumer solution?**_ An activation voucher or activation code is usually a QR code, supplied by the operator, which can be used by the end user to download a subscription Profile to a Consumer device.
13. _**How is this activation voucher used to download a subscription Profile?**_ After reading the QR code using its camera and a supporting application, the device is able to connect to the SM-DP+ named in the voucher and allows the eUICC to initiate a Profile download. The download will be made for the specific eUICC of the device. The activation voucher can be printed on a piece of paper, sent to the customer by email (after completing the activation process), or displayed on a screen (e.g. at the Point of Sale). All these options are viable, depending on the desired customer experience.
14. _**Who is the owner of the eUICC?**_ The eUICC, if embedded in the device, is part of the device and will thus be owned by the deviceowner. However, like the main device operating system, the eUICC firmware is licensed to the subscriber by various parties.
15. _**Who is the owner of the Profile?**_ eSIM allows the operator to download and manage their Profiles containing the subscription credentials and potentially some applications. The operator is the owner of the Profile and licenses its use to the subscriber.


# Account Abstraction

> "_**Account abstraction is a revolutionary concept in blockchain technology that allows for the creation of virtual accounts that can securely and seamlessly access multiple existing crypto wallets. This opens up new possibilities for decentralized applications and enables a wide range of users to participate in the web3 ecosystem.**_”


## Account Abstraction

The adoption of cryptocurrencies has been hindered by the lack of user-friendly interfaces and security issues. The current approach of having one-account-fits-all is limiting the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. However, the introduction of account abstraction is a game-changer that offers a more tailored approach to account management.

Account abstraction offers a solution to the limitations of the current approach of having one-account-fits-all. With account abstraction, accounts can be customized to the user's needs, allowing for multiple signers, social recovery, enhanced security, and more. This offers a much slicker user experience while making self-custody a viable option for a mainstream audience.

The current Ethereum accounts are made up of three components: a state containing a balance and nonce, hardcoded logic in the EVM to validate and execute a transaction from the account, and an address. The coupling of accounts and signers has its problems, and losing a private key means losing the account, which could lead to the loss of millions of dollars. Account abstraction moves crypto from the current approach of one-account-fits-all to a future where an account can be tailored to someone's needs.

Implementing account abstraction on Ethereum Layer 1 is difficult, and it has not been widely adopted. However, Argent has pioneered smart contract wallets that provide many of the benefits of account abstraction without requiring protocol changes. With these wallets, every user can deploy and use an account with custom authorization logic tailored to their needs, allowing for multiple signers, social recovery, and enhanced security. This offers a much slicker user experience while making self-custody a viable option for a mainstream audience.

Account abstraction also introduces features such as multicall, session keys, social recovery, and enhanced security. Multicall allows bundling of multiple transactions into one, making it a faster and more secure process. Session keys protect assets while maximizing ease of use. Social recovery replaces the need for seed phrases, allowing the owner of the account to authorize a new key as the legitimate wallet owner. The multi-factor authentication and enhanced security feature of account abstraction allows users to have customized security levels that meet their needs while using a variety of devices to approve transactions.

The innovation of account abstraction is crucial in unlocking the potential for mass adoption of cryptocurrency. It solves the limitations of the current approach of one-account-fits-all while offering a much slicker user experience and making self-custody a viable option for a mainstream audience. With account abstraction, the future of cryptocurrency looks brighter than ever before.


### Breaking down Account Abstraction with a few talks/conversation on it:

## 1. [ELI5: Account Abstraction by Liraz | Devcon Bogotá](https://youtu.be/QuYZWJj65AY)

- Account abstraction is a new way of managing accounts in Ethereum beyond the current externally owned account (EOA) system.
- EOAs have limitations in terms of key management, access control, gas payment, efficiency, and privacy.
- Account abstraction allows for more flexible logic that can be controlled by code, opening up new possibilities.
- Use cases for account abstraction include social recovery, dead man switch, and more complex access control policies.
- Learning and understanding account abstraction can help developers create more efficient and secure applications on the Ethereum blockchain.


## 2. [**Why Account Abstraction is a Game-Changer for Dapps | Devcon Bogotá**](https://youtu.be/OwppworJGzs)

- The talk is about account abstraction and its potential to be a game-changer for the user experience (UX) of decentralized applications (dapps).
- The speaker believes that self-custody is important for true digital ownership, but it is hard to achieve, even for experts.
- The problem with self-custody lies in how Ethereum accounts were designed at the beginning of Ethereum, where the concept of the signer and the account are tightly coupled.
- Account abstraction is the idea of decoupling the relationship between the signer and the account by making every account a smart contract that can contain its own logic.
- Account abstraction has been around since 2016 with the first EIP being proposed in early 2017, but it has mainly been implemented at the application layer.
- EIP 2938 was introduced in 2020 to make it easier to write and operate smart contract wallets, and EIP 4337 is an interesting architecture that can lead to native account abstraction in the future.
- The key benefit of account abstraction is that it can improve the UX of dapps by making self-custody easier for users while still ensuring security.
- The speaker concludes that understanding account abstraction is essential for anyone interested in the future of Ethereum and dapp development.


## 3. [Account Abstraction Panel | Devcon Bogotá](https://youtu.be/WsZBymiyT-8)

- The panel is discussing account abstraction, which has been a topic in Ethereum for a long time.

- Account abstraction is considered crucial for the future of Ethereum by many technical people.

- The panelists include Julian Niss from Argent, Yoav Weiss from the Ethereum Foundation, Matt from the Geth team, and Vitalik Buterin.

- Account abstraction is important for usability, particularly for making it easier for non-technical users to use Ethereum.

- Argent is a smart contract-based wallet that aims to improve the user experience of Ethereum.

- Account abstraction would make smart contract-based wallets first-class citizens in the Ethereum ecosystem.

- The term "account abstraction" has different meanings for different people, but for some, it refers to validation abstraction for achieving quantum resistance.


  ### Motivation for discussion:

  - What are the technical challenges involved in implementing account abstraction in Ethereum?
  - How would account abstraction improve the user experience of Ethereum and make it more accessible to non-technical users?
  - What impact could account abstraction have on the development of decentralized applications on Ethereum?

1. **Technical challenges in implementing account abstraction in Ethereum:**

## Problem

User Privacy: The traditional SIM card and eSIMs stores information such as **user metadata, location and phone number, contact lists and a few text messages with network credentials(authentication keys, encryption keys, signing keys and more keys) alongside with profile attributes.**  With the rise of eSIM technology, many devices are now using embedded SIMs that are built into the device and can be programmed remotely. While eSIMs provide benefits such as flexibility and convenience in installation and activation, But securing user personal information in a central server(from the time of physical SIM cards) introduces security and privacy breaches, Although with eSIM, SIM Swap attacks were prevented. Misusage of user personal information through mobile network provider’s servers and middle parties is still not ending.

User Exp: User experience in blockchain applications isn’t good enough for an average person but users should take advantage of this tech without bothering user experience.


## Solution

Blockchain comes with transparency and security where you can track everything and by associating a user with a cryptographic wallet or a smart contract wallet in a similar way a person gets associated with a mobile number, enhancing the users access to decentralized application through default app lock methods and executing transaction at device’s system level. This project aims to solve these challenges by building a blockchain-powered eSIM solution that integrates with the user's crypto wallets, decentralizing eSIM profile management and providing cryptographic identity services and privacy features. The unique ID of the eSIM will be mapped with the user's crypto wallets, enabling them to access applications and services using their fingerprints. The eSIM will be backed by zero-knowledge proofs during the user authentication process to ensure the privacy and security of the user's data.

By leveraging the concept of account abstraction, we aim to provide a seamless and secure eSIM solution that is resistant to data breaches and other security threats for all types of users. This solution will provide users with enhanced privacy and security, while also offering a more convenient and user-friendly experience.
