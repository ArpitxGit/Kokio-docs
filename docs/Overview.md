Welcome to the Blockchain Powered eSIM, Blockchain Powered eSIM is an idea of building an Open Source eSIM using modern cryptography, blockchain, telecommunication and mobile computing for better UX and mass adoption. The motivation of this project is to enhance the user experience comprehensively across all dimensions. As the intersection of mobile telecommunications and blockchain technology, a new paradigm, we are dedicated to utilies:

> The way mobile devices connect and interact with networks globally for mass adoption,
> Blockchains that offers immutability and transperancy with ownership,
> Modern cryptography for data integrity,
> Resulting in allowing users to do more than just communicate.

The eSIM Stack consist of three layers:

- LPA(Local Profile Assistant, Mobile App)
- RSP(Remote SIM Provisioning, Server and Protocol)
- eUICC(Embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card, Chip in mobile device)

Kokio is an mobile application which serves as entry point in telecom and digital world using eSIM and Smart Contracts.
