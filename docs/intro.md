# Kokio

A platform that focuses on **true ownership, privacy and security** in global connectivity,  
By leveraging **eSIMs and Smart Contracts**,  
To deliver **secure and self-custodial** Smart Wallets,  
For eSIMs(_**the entry point in the network state**_)  
That lives on decentralized network(_**the entry point in the ownership state**_).

## eSIM

An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM card that's embedded directly into a device, such as a phone or smartwatch, This new specification gives consumers the freedom to remotely connect devices, such as wearables, to a mobile network of their choice and continues to evolve the process of connecting new and innovative devices.

## The problem,

> With the new specification, the right of independent service providers to transmit commands of loading profiles to SIM-cards in the device has been amended and the possibility to store arrays of profiles in independent certified data centers (Subscriptions manager) has appeared.

## The Solution

Self Custodial Smart Contract Wallets

### Smart Contract

Smart contracts improves the management of profile arrays stored in independent certified data centers by automating and securing the process of transmitting and loading SIM profiles.  
Through a decentralized and transparent mechanism, smart contracts ensure that only authorized entities can access or modify profiles, reducing the risk of unauthorized tampering or data breaches.

### Smart Contract Wallets

Smart contract wallets for eSIMs provide a secure, decentralized solution for managing eSIM-related activities such as activation, profile switching, and payments.  
With a smart contract wallet, users can store their eSIM profiles in a tamper-proof and transparent environment, where automated rules govern actions like transferring ownership, changing network plans, or updating profiles without needing intermediaries.

### Self Custodial

A self-custodial smart contract wallet on a mobile device gives users full control over their assets, including eSIM profiles, without relying on a third party for security or management.  
_**The user holds the private keys directly on their device, enabling them to execute actions like profile switching, payments, and authentication autonomously.**_
With a mobile-first approach, the wallet is designed for everyday users, offering a user-friendly interface that simplifies managing eSIM profiles, performing transactions and manage digital assets.

## How it works?

- Derives an unqiue identity from mobile device which is then used to,
  - The unique identity helps to uniquely identify the device for eSIM installation and installation.
- Deploy smart wallets and allows to purchase eSIMs for connectivity and
  - Smart Wallets deployed on decentralised networks, provide true ownership of eSIM and digital assets as the credentials of access to the wallets are stored in the mobile device secure element using `passkeys` similar how eSIM credentials are stored within secure element using `euiccmanager`.
- Opens up the domain of digital assets in one platform.

API Parternships with eSIM providers and aggregators provides flexibility in selecting different eSIM plans, eSIM Profile purchase, installation and activation and by design Kokio delivers better user experience with simple checkout via FIAT or Cryptocurrencies.
