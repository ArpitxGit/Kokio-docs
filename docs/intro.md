# What is Kokio?

Kokio is a platform that focuses on true ownership, privacy and security in global connectivity by leveraging eSIMs and Smart Contracts to deliver secure and self-custodial eSIMs for seamless mobile experiences and more. Kokio inherits the security of connectivity from current telecom landscape via eSIMs and provide ownership for that connectivity using smart contracts which lives on decentralised network. Kokio a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good), embodies the ethos of [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and nurturing the [infinite garden](https://ethereum.foundation/infinitegarden). Kokio contributes to the evolution of tech as a shared resource, fostering a more inclusive and secure digital future for all in world where privacy and control over personal data are paramount.

## How Kokio works?

Kokio derives an unqiue identity from mobile device which is then used to deploy smart wallets and allows to purchase eSIMs for connectivity and opens up the domain of digital assets in one platform.  
The unique identity helps to uniquely identify the device for eSIM installation and installation.  
Smart Wallets deployed on decentralised networks, provide true ownership of eSIM and digital assets as the credentials of access to the wallets are stored in the mobile device secure element using passkeys similar how eSIM credentials are stored within secure element using `euiccmanager`.
Parternship with eSIM providers helps kokio to provide eSIM in bundles which provides flexibility and better user experience in selecting different eSIM plans and simple checkout via FIAT or Cryptocurrencies.
